- Hello, I'm @GiovaneNardari.
- I'm an undergraduate in 'Data Science and Artificial Intelligence' at PUC-Campinas (Pontifícia Universidade Católica de Campinas)
- From early on I had discovered my passion for programming, even though, by that time, I did not try to learn many things by myself... However, I've finally started my graduation and now I'm aching to learn everything possible about programming and data science, but focusing manly on big-data analisys and AI implementation.
- I will be trying to keep this profile filled with good examples of all the things that have aroused interest in me from this programming environment.
