- Hello, I'm @GiovaneNardari.
- I'm currently learning different programming languages from my college graduation in 'Data Science and Artificial Intelligence' at PUC-Campinas (Pontifícia Universidade Católica de Campinas), such as Python, C, Java and R.
- From early on I had discovered my passion for programming, even though, by that time, I did not try to learn many things by myself... However, I've finally started my graduation and now I'm aching to learn everything possible about programming, but focusing manly on big-data analisys and AI implementation for now.
- I will be trying to keep this profile filled with good examples of all the things that have aroused interest in me from this programming environment.
- Eventually, when this profile finally becomes charming enough, fell free to reach out to me.
